To say the least this list is not complete or prioritize.

Wish list

Get USB support working on FreeBSD.

Add reasonable authentication for VoIP connections.

Modify code to give the option of sending CTCSS tone to a different 
output than voice when card is run in stereo mode.
    
Add ability to adjust repeat levels in software as well as hardware to
get a finer control than the 1 DB steps typically available on sound boards.
    
Add support for recording the local RF connection to the .record command.

Provide support for sampling rates other than 8000 ?

Add optional file locking for access to USB dongle GPIOs to allow external 
program to take over control of GPIOs to send frequency information, etc.  
IRLP style sharing can be used for the parallel port.  Sharing the serial 
port is not as simple, perhaps an interface between external program and 
thelinkbox to have the linkbox open and close the serial port on demand?

Add .connect option to hide connections from user list for nailed up
connections.

Add (if it's not there already) logging of PID to the startup log messages.

Add ability to drop CTCSS encode during an ID when no other audio is present.

Add the ability to turn an external CTCSS encoder on and off in support of the
above.

Add ^C handler to tlbcmd when built w/ readline so we can save the history
and cleanup the terminal settings before exit.

===============================================================================
Fix bugs:

.rehash crash

echoing audio when live audio from an RF port is mixed with a .wav file.

.set tonespec = ... works, but the response is "variable ToneSpec is not set"
since you can't view a tonespec.

disconnect "#" then reconnect before the connection completely times out
results in "you are already connected", but the kick bits aren't reset.

sometimes at the end of a dtmf command completed by a timeout a burst of
touchtone is heard.  This should have been long gone!  Where is it being
held ???

Host names are only resolved to IP address once for a connect command.  This
isn't going to play with Dyanmic IP addresses very well... fix, fix.

Test DtmfCTCSSMode.  I think it works, but K7KAJ doesn't.

Add minimal matching logic to set command to prevent the need to type in
the complete (and long) variable name.

Add password to initial sdes packets if one is defined.

add time stamps to audio buffers for later use by voting

remove email address check when echolink is disabled.

remove -L or -R check when echolink is disabled.

prevent id from starting hang timer

Restore TxTone variable to it can be initialized easily from the configuration
file without having to write a script to do it.  

rewrite tonegen routine to eliminate the use of floating point

Add aux bit access: createaux <Aux name> <port> <number of bits> <shift>
.aux set <Aux name> = <value>
.aux read [-x] <aux name>


Add support for multiple CTCSS tones for software decoder.  Also multiple
bit inputs from external decoders?  Maybe just two.  Allows interesting
applications like using one tone for local repeat and a different tone
to enable VoIP/remote bases.

Disabling Echolink (bEchoLinkEnabled = 0) kills the command port if it's
on 5198 ...


idle timeouts for tlb, and an event generated when there's a Rx or Tx timeout.
