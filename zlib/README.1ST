The files in this subdirectory are not the complete distribution of the
zlib library, nor are they necessarily the most recent.  I've only included 
files actually needed by CQiNet applications to minimize bloat.

The files here were originally taken from the 1.1.4 release of the zlib 
library.

Before using this code in other projects I would suggest that you visit the 
original author's web site at:
