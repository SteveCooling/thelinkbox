hrprof - High Resolution Profiling

 Experimental fine grain profiling using Pentium cycle counter.
 Be aware that:
   - it counts real time, not process virtual time
   - it tries to measure the processor clock speed each time, so may
     get different scale factors each time
   - it will exit if it can't allocate memory
   - it's barely tested

To use:

First, "make install".

Then, compile some or all of the files of your program with the added
flag "-finstrument-functions".  Don't use the traditional profiling
flags (such as "-pg" or "-p").

Add "-lhrprof" to the link line.

When your program exits normally, it will write the file gmon.out, which
can be interpreted by the standard "gprof" program.

If you forget to give -lhrprof, your program will still link and run, but
it will not produce gmon.out, and it will be slowed down a little.

Type "make test" for an example.

If you try this out, please send mail to pace@alum.mit.edu with your
experiences and suggestions.
