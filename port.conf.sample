;CosPollRate = 0

; Set the following variable to 1 if this port is a repeater.  When 
; RepeaterPort is set the port's receiver is automatically linked to the

;
; Mode 4 (Anti-CTCSS) maybe useful for a carrier squelch repeater with

; If the sound board input is connected to an audio source that is not gated 
; by COS (it has noise on it when no one is talking) then set this

;
; An interesting problem occurs when the input audio source is unsquelched,
; namely you may hear a "squelch tail" at the beginning of transmissions!

; Over the air APRS specific variables (the global avrs variables in
; the main system configuration and the Ax25 variable above must also be set
; for these variables to have any effect)

; Set this variable to send an APRS object in the Ax25 beacon.
; The APRS object's comment field is set to this ports frequency, offset and 
; CTCSS unless the Ax25BeaconText variable above is set.
;Ax25BeaconAPRS=1

; Set this variable to send to send your transmitter power, antenna
; height and antenna gain in APRS packets sent via RF.
; NB: The Kenwood D7 and D700 radios are confused by these values and
; they are not very readable to humans since each value is encoded into
; a single digit
;EnableRfPHG = 0

; The following port specific variables override the global variables of the
; same name.  This is useful for a multiband repeater system when it is
; desirable to beacon different information on each band.
; Transmitter power in watts
;TxPower = 10

; Antenna height above average terrain in feet
;Haat = 100

; Antenna gain in DB
;AntGain = 3

; Heading of the main antenna lobe in degrees.
; If antenna is an omni enter 0.0, if the antenna is directional and pointed 
; due north enter 360.0.
;AntDir = 0.0

; Transmitter frequency in Mhz
;Frequency = 146.52

; Receiver offset from transmitter in Mhz for repeaters, leave unset for
; simplex nodes.
;RptOffset = -.6

; Continuous tone coded squelch system system frequency required to open
; receiver's squelch. In Hertz.  Leave unset for carrier squelch system
;CTCSS = 100.0
